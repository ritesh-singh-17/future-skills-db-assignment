1. Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.
The relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities is a one-to-many relationship. This is established through the foreign key constraint in the "Product" table. Specifically, the "Product" table has a column named 'category_id', which is a foreign key referencing the primary key 'id' of the "Product_Category" table. This means that each product in the "Product" table can be associated with only one category from the "Product_Category" table. However, a single category from the "Product_Category" table can be associated with multiple products in the "Product" table.




2. How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?
To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, you can enforce referential integrity using foreign key constraints. This constraint is already implemented in the database schema with the following statement:
ALTER TABLE `product`
  ADD CONSTRAINT `product_ibfk_1` FOREIGN KEY (`category_id`) REFERENCES `product_category` (`id`);
This constraint ensures that the value in the 'category_id' column of the "Product" table must exist in the 'id' column of the "Product_Category" table. In other words, it ensures that each product's 'category_id' value references a valid category in the "Product_Category" table, preventing the insertion of products with invalid category IDs. This way, you can guarantee that each product in the "Product" table is associated with a valid category from the "Product_Category" table.
